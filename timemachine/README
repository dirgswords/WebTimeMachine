This is a web based time machine. It should enable users to create and update the news on a particular day they travel to... It utilizes a MySql Database to store information and provides users access to update information / news on any day they travel.  I'm looking for any advice really on any parts of the code.  I want to learn best practices, security etc.  This is a working example but I'm not sure if there might not be better ways of coding this.  Thanks in advance for any help.
